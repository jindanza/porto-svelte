      <p>
        RESTful APIs are designed to enable structured communication between
        client and server using standard HTTP methods. Node.js is commonly used
        as the runtime environment due to its non-blocking, event-driven nature,
        which ensures high performance and scalability. Authentication and
        authorization mechanisms are often implemented using JWT (JSON Web
        Tokens) or OAuth 2.0 to secure endpoints and manage user access.

    <li class="font-bold">Back-end</li>
    <div class="border-l border-gray-400 px-4 py-2 ml-1">
      <p>
        Back-end development involves handling server logic, data management,
        and system integration. Express.js, a minimalist web framework for
        Node.js, is widely used to build scalable and modular backend
        applications. Sequelize serves as an ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
        tool that simplifies interaction with relational databases such as
        PostgreSQL, allowing developers to write database queries using
        JavaScript instead of SQL directly.

    <li class="font-bold">Front-end</li>
    <div class="border-l border-gray-400 px-4 py-2 ml-1">
      <p>
        Front-end development focuses on creating user-facing interfaces and
        ensuring smooth client-side interaction. React.js is a popular
        JavaScript library for building component-based user interfaces, while
        Next.js extends Reactâ€™s capabilities with features like server-side
        rendering and API routing. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework
        that speeds up styling by offering a wide range of pre-defined classes,
        enabling responsive and modern UI development with minimal custom CSS.

    <div class="border-l border-gray-400 px-4 py-2 ml-1">
      <p>
        UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) design focus on making
        digital products visually appealing, intuitive, and easy to use. Figma
        is a web-based design tool used for creating wireframes, high-fidelity
        mockups, and prototypes. It supports collaborative workflows, allowing
        designers and developers to align seamlessly on user-centric interfaces
        that enhance usability and overall experience.
